### h('h1', { class: 'hat' }, 'Hello World');

My name is Jan Dolansk√Ω (23/_98) and I am a web developer, designer and iced coffee enthusiast.
I come from the heart of the EU, Czech, but more often than not you'll find me enjoying the northern breeze of Finland.

I've started learning web development from scratch at the start of 2018 and since then I've never 
stopped working on myself and my skills. It's a big passion of mine and I never want to stop learning new things

My areas of expertise include
- Javascript
- CSS/LESS/SASS (container queries when)
- Vue.js (ver. 2 & 3, vuex, vuelidate)
- HTML5
- Web design (mainly SaaS)
