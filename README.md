### h('div', helloWorld());

My name is Jan Dolansk√Ω (23/_98) and I am a web developer, designer and iced coffee enthusiast.
I come from the heart of the EU, Czech, but more often than not you'll find me enjoying the northern breeze of Finland.

I've started learning web development from scratch at the start of 2018 and since then I've never 
stopped working on myself and my skills.

My areas of expertise include
- Javascript
- CSS/LESS/SASS (container queries when)
- Vue.js (ver. 2 & 3, vuex, vuelidate)
- HTML5
