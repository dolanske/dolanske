### hello_world();

My name is Jan Dolansk√Ω (22/_98) and I am a web developer, designer and iced coffee enthusiast.
I come from the heart of the EU, Czech. And I keep bouncing back and forth between Finland.

I have started web development from scratch at the start of 2018 and since then I've never 
stopped learning since! 

Some of the tools I have worked and I am familiar with

- less/scss
- html5
- javascript & Vue.js (basic understanding of React.js)
- php
- Adobe Xd, Photoshop
- Iced coffee making (!!)

## Also most importantly

.hat {
  color: yellow;
}
