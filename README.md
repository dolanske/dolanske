### h('h1', { class: 'hat' }, 'Hello World');

My name is Jan Dolansk√Ω (23/98) and I am a web developer, designer and iced coffee enthusiast.
I come from the heart of the EU, Czech, but more often than not you'll find me enjoying the northern breeze of Finland.

I've started learning web development from scratch at the start of 2018 and since then I've never 
stopped working on my skills and staying up to date with the state of the web.

My areas of expertise include
- Javascript
- CSS/Less/Sass
- Vue.js (ver. 2 & 3, vuex, vuelidate)
- HTML5
- SaaS platform UI/UX design and implementation
